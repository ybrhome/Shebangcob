### **Project Name: Shebangcob**
**A Minimalist, Local-First Personal Bookmark Manager**

#### **📖 Overview**
Shebangcob is a pure frontend, privacy-focused bookmark management tool designed for digital minimalists and developers. Unlike traditional cloud-based services, Shebangcob operates entirely within the browser using **LocalStorage**, ensuring zero latency, 100% data privacy, and full offline capability.

It features a smart sorting algorithm that automatically categorizes URLs by their main domain (ignoring prefixes like `www`) and arranges them alphabetically for rapid access.

#### **✨ Key Features**

* **🔒 Local-First & Privacy-Focused:** No servers, no databases, and no tracking. Your data lives and stays in your browser.
* **🧠 Smart Domain Sorting:** Includes a custom algorithm that intelligently strips `www.` and subdomains to categorize links correctly (e.g., `google.com` appears under **G**, not **W**).
* **⚡ High Efficiency:**
    * **Instant Search:** Real-time filtering by title or URL.
    * **Quick Navigation:** A fixed left-sidebar alphabet index for jumping between categories.
    * **Batch Operations:** A "Select Mode" allows for bulk management and deletion of links.
* **💾 Data Sovereignty:** Full support for **JSON Export (Backup)** and **Import**, allowing you to migrate your data between devices or browsers easily.
* **🎨 Clean UI:** Built with **Bootstrap 5**, featuring a responsive design, modal interactions, and a polished user experience.

#### **🛠️ Tech Stack**
* **Core:** HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)
* **Styling:** Bootstrap 5.3 + Custom CSS
* **Storage:** Browser LocalStorage API
* **Icons/Fonts:** Google Fonts (Playfair Display)

#### **🚀 How to Use**
Simply open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser. No installation, build process, or server setup is required.
